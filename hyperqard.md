# Quantum Hype Scorecard (aka the Hyper Qard)

A simple scoring card for measuring the amount of hype in a quantum computing press release.
Inspired by John Baez's [Crackpot Index](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html).
If you have more criteria, submit a pull request!

* 1 point for every use of the word "breakthrough".

* 1 point for every use of the word "transformative".

* 1 point for every "unprecedented" result.

* 1 point for the first industry revolutionized, 3 points for the next five industries revolutionized, and 10 points revolutionizing any further industries. 

* 1 point for every usage of "q" instead of "c"-like in a business name or product.

* 1 point for every accompanying picture which is just blue and swishy.

* 2 point for every seamless transition from "*could* transform quantum computing" to
"*will* transform quantum computing".

* 5 points for each reference to quantum computer's power arising from  "trying all solutions in parallel".  -3 points if you realize that means there are some universes where you do not solve the problem.

* 5 points for each mention of quantum computers solving a major world issue, without a reference to how this might arise.  "We'll solve global warming by using our magic quantum computer."

* 5 points for mistaking quantum correlations for classical shared randomness.

* 5 points for every claim of a breakthrough in solving a business problem in a quantum experiment, when that problem can be solved by a classical computer today faster, cheaper, and/or more robustly.  5 more points if you can do this by just simulating the quantum computer on your laptop.  2 more points if that simulation can be done in Python.

* 5 points for benchmarking against an inefficient classical algorithm.

* 5 points for entanglement being used for instantaneous faster than light communication.

* 5 points for every technology advance that really needs to be postfixed by "in this
particular unrealistic experimental setup on that particular day" and does not say so.

* 5 points for seamlessly transferring from un-error-corrected quantum algorithms to
error-corrected quantum algorithms without saying the words "error correction" or
"fault-tolerant".

* 5 points for using Grover to search a database.

* 5 points for every new metric designed to make you look better. 5 more points if that number is a just a renaming of a previous metric.  

* 10 points for claims of benchmark metric values without experimental demonstration.

* 10 points for solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time.

* 10 points for claiming quantum advantage without any proof.

* 10 points for a claim of advantage without a [red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) or any independent verification.

* 10 points for claiming quantum computers are key to artificial general 
intelligence without any backing for this claim.

* 15 points for claiming quantum computers are key to solving humanity's most difficult problems,
from climate change to aging, without any backing for these claims.

* 15 points for solving PSPACE-complete problems in polynomial time.

* 20 points for solving uncomputable problems in polynomial time.
