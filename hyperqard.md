# Quantum Hype Scorecard (aka the Hyper Qard)

A simple scoring card for measuring how much closer a press release moves the world to quantum winter.
Inspired by John Baez's [Crackpot Index](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html).

1 point for every use of the word "breakthrough".

1 point for every use of the word "transformative".

1 point for every "unprecedented" result.

1 point for the first industry revolutionized, 3 points for the next five industries revolutionized, and 10 points revolutionizing any further industries. 

1 point for every usage of "q" instead of "c"-like in a business name or product.

5 points for each reference to quantum computer's power arising from  "trying all solutions in parallel".

5 points for each mention of quantum computers solving a major world issue, without a reference to how this might arise.  "We'll solve global warming by using our magic quantum computer."

5 points for mistaking quantum correlations for classical shared randomness.

5 points for every business problem solved which can be solved by a classical computer
today faster, cheaper, and more robustly.

5 points for instantaneous faster than light communication.

5 points for every technology advance that really needs to be postfixed by "in this
particular unrealistic experimental setup on that particular day" and does not say so.

5 points for seamlessly transferring from un-error-corrected quantum algorithms to
error-corrected quantum algorithms without saying the words "error correction" or
"fault-tolerant".

5 points for using Grover to search a database.

5 points for every new metric designed to make you look better. 5 more points if that number is a just a renaming of a previous metric.

10 points for solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time.

10 points for claiming quantum advantage without any proof.

10 points for a claim of advantage without a [red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team). 

15 points for solving PSPACE-complete problems in polynomial time.

20 points for solving uncomputable problems in polynomial time.
